IPL Data Analysis Project

This project performs an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset using Python.
It includes raw match data, cleaning steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visual insights to understand team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes.

The project is beginner-friendly and ideal for anyone learning Python, Pandas, data visualization, and real-world dataset handling.

🎯 Objective of the Project

The goal of this project is to:

Clean and prepare the IPL dataset

Analyze match results, player performance, and team metrics

Visualize trends and insights

Build a strong foundation in data analytics using a real sports dataset

🔍 Key Steps Performed in the Notebook
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked dataset size, shape, and structure

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Converted datatypes

Removed duplicates

Renamed confusing columns

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top run scorers

Highest wicket takers

Team win percentages

Venue-wise match distribution

Toss decision analysis

Match result patterns

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Using Matplotlib/Seaborn, created graphs such as:

Bar charts

Line plots

Pie charts

Count plots

Distribution plots

📊 Insights from the Dataset

Some typical findings (based on IPL data analysis):

Certain stadiums favor batting or bowling

Teams winning the toss do/don’t always win the match

Top players show strong consistency across venues

Run scoring patterns change based on overs and pitch conditions

(Your notebook will generate detailed insights.)
